## Process and objectives

The main focus of this project on the bootcamp was study performance and API request.
In this project we use the Json-server to simulate our API, that served us with our data. We use Axios to do the HTTP requests. Styled components to styles and create variants of the components. Radix ui to get the radio button and Portal Dialog structure pure, with no css aplied.
From the main focus, ReactJS, was used some hooks as UseCallback, useEffect, useContext.
